The Vertex Client Ruby Gem provides an interface to integrate with Vertex Cloud's REST API.

## Usage

### Quotation

```ruby
response = VertexClient.quotation(
  # The top level transaction date for all line items.
  date: '2018-11-15',
  # The top level customer for all line items.
  customer: {
    code: "inky@customink.com",
    address_1: "11 Wall Street",
    address_2: "#300",
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY",
    postal_code: '10005'
  },
  # The top level seller for all line items.
  seller: {
    company: "CustomInk"
  },
  line_items: [
    {
      product_code: "t-shirts",
      quantity: 7,
      price: "35.50",
    },
    {
      product_code: "t-shirts",
      quantity: 4,
      price: "25.40",
      # Optional transaction date override for a line item.
      date: '2018-11-14',
      # Optional seller override for a line item.
      seller: {
        company: "Custom Ink Stores"
      },
      # Optional customer override for a line item.
      customer: {
        code: "prez@customink.com",
        address_1: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW",
        city: "Washington",
        state: "DC",
        postal_code: '20500'
      }
    }
  ]
)

response.total_tax #=> Total tax amount
response.total     #=> Total price plus total tax
reponse.subtotal   #=> Total price before tax
```

### Invoice

Invoice is the same payload as quotation, but with one added identifier.

```ruby
VertexClient.invoice(
  # Vertex's Document Number is a unique referencial identifier for this invoice.
  document_number: "unique-identifier-1a43b",
  
  # ... All of the of the payload from quotation here ...
)

```

  config.soap_api = ENV.fetch('VERTEX_SOAP_API', 'https://vertex-soap-api.com')

  # Circuitbox configuration.
  # https://github.com/yammer/circuitbox#per-circuit-configuration
